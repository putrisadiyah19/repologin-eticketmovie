This is the login file for our group project. It is divided into two parts: frontend and backend. The frontend contains the React project, which handles the website's UI, while the backend includes Express, JWT, and MongoDB connections.

To check if you're working on the homework, the necessary code for screenshots is in these files:

MongoDB ==> backend/app.js
JWT == > backend/app.js, backend/routes/auth.js
Axios ==> frontend/login/src/Component/Login.js
You will need to install the following dependencies to run these files, as I have not included their respective node_modules:

Frontend (frontend/login): React, Axios, Bootstrap, and CORS
Backend (backend): Express, BcryptJS, Axios, CORS, and JsonWebToken

The login file will be updated further, as it currently looks quite basic. A registration form will be added later.
